**A World of Warcraft addon that visualizes your primary and secondary stats with dynamic bars that update in real-time
during combat.**

## Overview

PeaversDynamicStats provides visual representation of your character's stats through customizable bars. These bars
dynamically update during combat, allowing you to monitor stat procs and buffs exactly when you need to know if you're
about to deal massive damage.

## Features

- **Real-time Primary Stat Tracking**: Visualizes strength, agility, intellect, and stamina as percentage increases from
  base values
- **Real-time Secondary Stat Tracking**: Displays haste, critical strike, mastery, and versatility percentages with
  customizable bars
- **Stat History Tracking**: Records stat changes over time and displays historical data in tooltips
- **Combat-Aware Updates**: Increases update frequency during combat for more precise monitoring
- **Highly Customizable Interface**: Adjust bar colors, textures, spacing, height, width, and background opacity
- **Movable and Lockable Frame**: Position the stats display anywhere on your screen and lock it in place
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient design with minimal CPU usage, only updating bars when stat values change
- **Show/Hide Individual Stats**: Choose which stats to display based on your preferences and class needs
- **Combat-Only Mode**: Option to automatically hide the addon when out of combat and show it during combat
